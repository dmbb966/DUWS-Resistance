DUWS: Resistance

TO DO:
- Change introductary picture

Version 0.11 (15MAY14):


Version 0.10 (14MAY14):
- Added ability to set the season and approximate time of day that the mission starts.  These dates and times are somewhat randomized, but are adjusted to fit dawn and dusk timeframes based on the selected season.
- Added the placeholder to implement AAF integration, though this has not been implemented yet.
- Found and fixed a bug in the "ShowOSD" which displays the current date, time, and location.  It was misrepresenting "Southwest" as "Northwest"
- Implemented dynamic weather system
- Multiplayer is NOT supported.


Version 0.0 (Start 12MAY14):
- OBJECTIVES: analyze and clean up existing code.  Ended with a fair amount of understanding, as well as much weeping and gnashing of teeth.  I decided it would be easier and cleaner to build it from scratch, importing and cleaning up modules from DUWS piece by piece.
